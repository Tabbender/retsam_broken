+++++ CAUTION of saving backup +++++++++
Copy the old DLLs on the outside of the CodeWarrior installed directory.
OR,
Change the file name extension when you make backup of the old DLLs into 
the CodeWarrior installed directory.
    for example)  aaaa.dll  -->  aaaa.dll.bk

If you change only file name except for the extension OR you change only 
directory name, CodeWarrior IDE finds the old DLLs and enables both of new 
DLLs and old DLLs. The behavior of IDE isn't assured in such condition.

  Number     Problem Addressed
  =========  =================
- MTWX26488  Internal Compiler Error occurs in the specific
             combination of While() and If() (and etc...) when optimization level
             is 1 or higher.
- MTWX26781  There should be a peephole pattern that eliminates
             an extra mla instruction if the multiplication operand is
             obviously zero.
- MTWX27066  Compiler generates wrong code for the statement 
             "for(x=0;(x+=0x1000)!=0;){...}" when the optimization level
              is 3 or higher. 
- MTWX27252  Internal compiler Error in file 'ConstantPools.c' line: 625.
- MTWX27574  Compiler generates wrong code for "switch(){}"
             sentence when a "if(){}" sentence is used just before it and
             optimization level is 2 or higher.
- FB5076     Debugger can not run a Thumb code built project which has overlay.
- FB5493     Request for improving the Debugger so that the BP on overlay works
